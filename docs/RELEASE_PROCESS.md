# Release Process

This document outlines the steps to create and publish a new release of Tandem.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Runtime, desktop, and registry publishing are intentionally separated:
>
> - `.github/workflows/release.yml` handles runtime GitHub Release assets and registry dispatch.
> - `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml` optionally builds Tauri desktop bundles for an existing tag.
> - `.github/workflows/publish-registries.yml` handles crates.io, npm, and PyPI publishing.

## Overview

Tandem uses **Git tags** to trigger automated builds and releases. When you push a tag matching the pattern `v*.*.*` (e.g., `v0.1.10`), GitHub Actions automatically:

- Builds runtime binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Builds the Linux x64 enterprise engine artifact
- Creates a GitHub Release with the runtime artifacts
- Publishes the release notes
- Dispatches registry publishing

Desktop bundles are no longer built on every tag. Run **Desktop Release** manually for a tag when a desktop build is actually needed.

## Registry Publish Workflow (Crates + npm)

Use the separate workflow `.github/workflows/publish-registries.yml` to publish registries.

### Triggers

- Manual: **Actions -> Publish Registries -> Run workflow**
- Tag-based: push a dedicated tag `publish-v<version>` (for example `publish-v0.3.3`)
  to trigger the workflow. The workflow publishes from the canonical release tag
  `v<version>`, so the `publish-v<version>` tag must not be used to carry release
  manifest changes.

### Manual workflow inputs

When running `publish-registries.yml` manually, set:

- `version`
- `publish_crates` (boolean)
- `publish_npm` (boolean)
- `publish_pypi` (boolean, independent toggle for Python package release)
- `dry_run` (boolean)

Notes:

- `publish_pypi` is intentionally decoupled from npm so Python release can be skipped/enabled independently.
- Tag-triggered `publish-v<version>` runs still enable crates/npm/PyPI together by default.

### Guardrails

- Uses protected environment `registry-publish` for approval-gated publish jobs.
- Requires crates secret:
  - `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
- npm publishing uses **Trusted Publishing (OIDC)** in GitHub Actions by default (no `NPM_TOKEN` required in CI).
- npm publish job enforces tokenless npm config (`NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG`) so Trusted Publishing is used instead of stale token auth.
- Token auth is only used when `NPM_PUBLISH_FORCE_TOKEN=true` is set in GitHub Actions variables and `NPM_TOKEN` is present. This is an escape hatch for packages that have not enabled Trusted Publishing yet.
- Validates manifest versions before publishing.
- Preflight uses static Cargo manifest/order validation (not `cargo package`), because crates with intra-workspace dependencies can fail publish-dry checks until earlier crates are actually published and propagated on crates.io.
- Skips already-published crate/npm versions so reruns are safe.

### Recommended Registry Publish Sequence

1. Ensure target version is already committed in manifests.
2. Run `publish-registries.yml` manually first with `dry_run=true`.
3. Re-run with `dry_run=false` after approval.
4. (Optional) use `publish-v<version>` tag for auditable repeatable trigger.

### Local npm Publishing (if needed)

For local manual npm publish (outside GitHub Actions), authenticate with npm CLI first:

```bash
npm login
```

Then publish from package folders:

```bash
cd packages/tandem-engine && npm publish --access public
cd packages/tandem-enterprise && npm publish --access public
cd packages/tandem-tui && npm publish --access public
```

Or use helper scripts:

```bash
./scripts/publish-npm-ci.sh --dry-run
./scripts/publish-npm-ci.sh
```

```powershell
.\scripts\publish-npm-ci.ps1 -DryRun
.\scripts\publish-npm-ci.ps1
```

## Prerequisites

Before creating a release, ensure:

- [ ] All changes are committed and pushed to `main`
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` is updated with the new version
- [ ] `RELEASE_NOTES.md` is finalized for the new version: replace
      `(Unreleased)` with the release date and use readable `###` sections or
      bullets for long releases
- [ ] Workflow-runtime fixes since the previous release have replay coverage
- [ ] Workflow fast gate and deep gate are green for release-relevant workflow changes
- [ ] Version numbers are updated with `./scripts/bump-version.sh <version>`
- [ ] Desktop version numbers are updated when desktop bundles will be published:
  - `apps/tandem-desktop/package.json`
  - `apps/tandem-desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - this is what the app reports as its version
  - `apps/tandem-desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

> [!CAUTION]
> **DO NOT create a release tag without running the version bump first.** For desktop releases, also verify:
>
> ```bash
> grep '"version"' apps/tandem-desktop/package.json
> grep '"version"' apps/tandem-desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
> grep '^version' apps/tandem-desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml
> ```

## Release Steps

### 1. Create a Git Tag

Create an annotated tag with the version number:

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.10 -m "Release v0.1.10: Skills Management"
```

**Format:**

- Tag name: `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` (e.g., `v0.1.10`)
- Message: Brief description of the release (e.g., "Release v0.1.10: Skills Management")

### 2. Push the Tag

Push the tag to trigger the automated build:

```bash
git push origin v0.1.10
```

Or push all tags at once:

```bash
git push --tags
```

### 3. Monitor the Build

1. Go to the [GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/frumu-ai/tandem/actions)
2. Look for the workflow run triggered by your tag
3. Wait for the runtime build to complete
4. Check for any build failures
5. If desktop bundles are needed, run **Actions -> Desktop Release -> Run workflow** with the same tag

### 4. Verify the Release

Once the build completes:

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/frumu-ai/tandem/releases)
2. Verify the new release is published
3. Check that runtime binaries are attached, including the Linux enterprise engine artifact
4. If you ran Desktop Release, check that desktop bundles were attached
5. Review the generated release notes

## Workflow Runtime Release Rules

If the release includes changes to workflow prompting, validation, repair routing, delivery routing, or status projection:

1. Run the workflow release checklist in [Engine Testing](./ENGINE_TESTING.md).
2. Confirm every workflow-runtime bug fix since the prior release has a deterministic replay regression.
3. Use [Workflow Bug Replay Guide](./WORKFLOW_BUG_REPLAY.md) when converting operator-reported failures into regressions.
4. Do not tag a release candidate if the workflow deep gate is red.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Create and push a release tag (all in one go)
git tag -a v0.1.10 -m "Release v0.1.10: Skills Management"
git push origin v0.1.10

# List all tags
git tag -l

# Delete a local tag (if you made a mistake)
git tag -d v0.1.10

# Delete a remote tag (if you need to redo)
git push origin --delete v0.1.10
```

## Versioning Guidelines

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (`1.0.0`): Breaking changes, major rewrites
- **MINOR** (`0.1.0`): New features, non-breaking changes
- **PATCH** (`0.0.1`): Bug fixes, minor improvements

### Current Phase (Pre-1.0)

Since we're in the `0.x.x` phase:

- Increment **MINOR** for new features (e.g., `0.1.0` → `0.2.0`)
- Increment **PATCH** for bug fixes (e.g., `0.1.0` → `0.1.1`)

## Troubleshooting

### Tag Already Exists

If you get an error that the tag already exists:

```bash
# Delete the local tag
git tag -d v0.1.10

# Delete the remote tag (if pushed)
git push origin --delete v0.1.10

# Recreate the tag
git tag -a v0.1.10 -m "Release v0.1.10: Skills Management"
git push origin v0.1.10
```

### Build Fails

If the automated build fails:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for errors
2. Fix any issues in the code
3. Delete and recreate the tag (see above)
4. Push the tag again

### Wrong Commit Tagged

If you tagged the wrong commit:

```bash
# Delete the tag
git tag -d v0.1.10
git push origin --delete v0.1.10

# Checkout the correct commit
git checkout <correct-commit-hash>

# Create the tag on the correct commit
git tag -a v0.1.10 -m "Release v0.1.10: Skills Management"
git push origin v0.1.10
```

## Post-Release

After a successful release:

- [ ] Announce the release (Discord, Twitter, etc.)
- [ ] Update any documentation that references version numbers
- [ ] Start a new section in `CHANGELOG.md` for the next version
- [ ] Close any related GitHub issues/milestones

## Example Workflow

Here's a complete example for releasing v0.1.10:

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on main with latest changes
git checkout main
git pull

# 2. Verify all changes are committed
git status

# 3. Create the tag
git tag -a v0.1.10 -m "Release v0.1.10: Skills Management"

# 4. Push the tag
git push origin v0.1.10

# 5. Monitor the build at:
# https://github.com/frumu-ai/tandem/actions

# 6. Once complete, verify at:
# https://github.com/frumu-ai/tandem/releases
```
