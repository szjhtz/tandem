# Engine Build, Run, and Test Guide

This guide covers:

- how to build and start `tandem-engine`
- how to run automated tests
- how to run the end-to-end smoke/runtime proof flow on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Quick commands

From `tandem/`:

```bash
cargo build -p tandem-engine
cargo run -p tandem-engine -- serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3000
cargo test -p tandem-server -p tandem-core -p tandem-engine
```

## CLI flags

`serve` supports:

- `--host` or `--hostname` (same option)
- `--port`
- `--state-dir`

State directory resolution order:

1. `--state-dir`
2. `TANDEM_STATE_DIR`
3. canonical shared storage data dir (`.../tandem/data`)

## Automated test layers

## 1) Rust unit/integration tests (fast, CI-friendly)

Run:

```bash
cargo test -p tandem-server -p tandem-core -p tandem-engine
```

Coverage includes route shape/contracts like:

- `/global/health`
- `/provider`
- `/api/session` alias behavior
- `/session/{id}/message`
- SSE `message.part.updated`
- permission approve/deny compatibility routes

Contract-focused tests (JSON-first orchestrator parsing):

```bash
cargo test -p tandem test_parse_task_list_strict -- --nocapture
cargo test -p tandem test_parse_validation_result_strict_rejects_prose -- --nocapture
```

## 2) Engine smoke/runtime proof (process + HTTP + SSE + memory)

This is the automated version of the manual proof steps and writes artifacts to `runtime-proof/`.

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
./scripts/engine_smoke.ps1
```

Optional args:

```powershell
./scripts/engine_smoke.ps1 -HostName 127.0.0.1 -Port 3000 -StateDir .tandem-smoke -OutDir runtime-proof
```

### macOS/Linux (bash)

Prerequisites:

- `jq`
- `curl`
- `ps`
- `pkill`

Run:

```bash
bash ./scripts/engine_smoke.sh
```

Optional env vars:

```bash
HOSTNAME=127.0.0.1 PORT=3000 STATE_DIR=.tandem-smoke OUT_DIR=runtime-proof bash ./scripts/engine_smoke.sh
```

## What smoke scripts validate

- engine starts and becomes healthy
- session create/list endpoints
- session message list endpoint has entries
- provider catalog endpoint
- SSE stream emits `message.part.updated`
- idle memory sample after 60s
- peak memory during tool-using prompt (with permission reply)
- cleanup leaves no rogue `tandem-engine` process

## Starting engine manually

### Windows

```powershell
cargo run -p tandem-engine -- serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3000 --state-dir .tandem
```

## Running with `pnpm tauri dev`

Tauri dev must be able to find the `tandem-engine` sidecar binary in a dev lookup path.
Use the binary built in `target/` and copy it into `src-tauri/binaries/`.

Important: the filename is the same (`tandem-engine` or `tandem-engine.exe`), but the directories are different.

### Windows (PowerShell)

From `tandem/`:

```powershell
pnpm engine:stop:windows
cargo build -p tandem-engine
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path .\src-tauri\binaries | Out-Null
Copy-Item .\target\debug\tandem-engine.exe .\src-tauri\binaries\tandem-engine.exe -Force
pnpm tauri dev
```

## Shared Engine Mode (Desktop + TUI together)

Desktop and TUI now use shared engine mode by default:

- fixed engine port: `127.0.0.1:3000`
- clients attach to an already-running engine when available
- closing one client detaches instead of force-stopping the shared engine

Disable shared mode (legacy single-client behavior) by setting:

```powershell
$env:TANDEM_SHARED_ENGINE_MODE="0"
```

If the app is stuck on `Connecting...` or fails to load, do a clean dev restart:

```powershell
pnpm tauri:dev:clean
```

Manual equivalent:

```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -in @('tandem','tandem-engine','node') } | Stop-Process -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
pnpm tauri dev
```

## JSON-first orchestrator feature flag

Strict planner/validator contract mode can be forced via env:

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
$env:TANDEM_ORCH_STRICT_CONTRACT="1"
pnpm tauri dev
```

### macOS/Linux (bash)

```bash
TANDEM_ORCH_STRICT_CONTRACT=1 pnpm tauri dev
```

Behavior in strict mode:

- planner uses strict JSON parse first
- validator uses strict JSON parse first
- prose fallback is still allowed by default (`allow_prose_fallback=true`) during phase 1
- contract degradation/failures emit `contract_warning` / `contract_error` orchestrator events

### macOS/Linux (bash)

From `tandem/`:

```bash
cargo build -p tandem-engine
mkdir -p ./src-tauri/binaries
cp ./target/debug/tandem-engine ./src-tauri/binaries/tandem-engine
chmod +x ./src-tauri/binaries/tandem-engine
pnpm tauri dev
```

### macOS/Linux

```bash
cargo run -p tandem-engine -- serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3000 --state-dir .tandem
```

## Build commands by OS

### Windows

```powershell
cargo build -p tandem-engine
```

### macOS/Linux

```bash
cargo build -p tandem-engine
```

## Rogue process cleanup

### Windows

```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -like 'tandem-engine*' } | Stop-Process -Force
```

### macOS/Linux

```bash
pkill -f tandem-engine || true
```

## Troubleshooting

- `Access is denied (os error 5)` on Windows build usually means `tandem-engine.exe` is still running and locked by the OS loader.
- Stop rogue engine processes, then rebuild.
- If bind fails, verify no process is already listening on your port.
- If startup log shows `Another instance tried to launch`, a previous app instance is still running. Close/kill all `tandem` processes and relaunch.
- For writable state/config, use `--state-dir` with a project-local directory.

## Storage migration verification (legacy upgrades)

When upgrading from builds that used `ai.frumu.tandem`, verify canonical migration:

1. Ensure `%APPDATA%/ai.frumu.tandem` exists with legacy data.
2. Ensure `%APPDATA%/tandem` is empty or absent.
3. Start Tandem app or engine once.
4. Verify `%APPDATA%/tandem/storage_version.json` and `%APPDATA%/tandem/migration_report.json` exist.
5. Verify sessions/tool history are visible without manual copying.
6. Verify `%APPDATA%/ai.frumu.tandem` remains intact (copy + keep legacy).

## Startup migration wizard verification (blocking progress UX)

1. Seed legacy data under either:
2. `%APPDATA%/ai.frumu.tandem`
3. `%APPDATA%/opencode`
4. `%USERPROFILE%/.local/share/opencode/storage`
5. Launch Tandem and unlock vault.
6. Verify full-screen migration overlay appears and blocks interaction until completion.
7. Verify progress updates through phases:
8. scanning -> copying -> rehydrating -> finalizing.
9. On success/partial, verify summary card shows repaired session/message counts.
10. Click Continue and verify chat history loads for migrated sessions.

## Settings migration rerun verification

1. Open Settings -> Data Migration.
2. Run `Dry Run` and verify result status reports `dry_run`.
3. Run `Run Migration Again` and verify counters update.
4. Verify `migration_report.json` timestamp updates and report path is shown.

## Workspace namespace migration verification (`.opencode` -> `.tandem`)

For an existing workspace that contains legacy metadata:

1. Ensure `<workspace>/.opencode/plans` and/or `<workspace>/.opencode/skill` exists.
2. Start Tandem and set/switch active workspace to that folder.
3. Verify `<workspace>/.tandem/plans` and `<workspace>/.tandem/skill` are created.
4. Verify plan list and skills list still include legacy entries.
5. Create a new plan and install/import a skill; verify new files are written under `.tandem/*`.
6. Confirm legacy `.opencode/*` remains untouched (read-compatible window).

## Workspace-scoped session history checks

1. With multiple projects configured, switch active folder in the project switcher.
2. Verify sidebar session list shows only sessions belonging to that folder.
3. Create a new chat in the active folder; verify it appears immediately in sidebar.
4. Verify sessions with legacy `directory = "."` still appear under current workspace.
