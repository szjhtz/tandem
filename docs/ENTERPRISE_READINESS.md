# Tandem Enterprise Readiness

This document separates what Tandem can credibly show today from what is still in progress or planned. Tandem is not yet a complete enterprise platform with OIDC, SCIM, turnkey SIEM connector integrations, SOC2, and private sidecar enforcement. The current proof is the runtime authority foundation those enterprise features will attach to, including tenant-aware policy decisions, governed approvals, scoped memory, protected audit evidence, and initial intra-tenant authority modeling.

## Available Now

- **Engine-owned run state:** Workflows and automations execute as durable runtime records rather than chat transcripts.
- **Plan preview and apply flow:** Intent can be compiled through plan preview/apply paths into runtime-owned workflow bundles.
- **Tenant context foundations:** The OSS enterprise contract includes tenant context, local implicit tenant defaults, principals, authority chains, and secret references.
- **Public enterprise status:** `/enterprise/status` exposes a public-safe summary of enterprise mode, bridge state, capabilities, contract version, and tenant context.
- **Approval gates and inbox:** Automation runs can pause on human gates, publish deadlines, reject late decisions after auto-cancel expiry, and process reminder or escalation policies while keeping the gate decidable. The control panel includes an Approvals Inbox backed by the pending approvals aggregator.
- **Approval channel fan-out:** Slack, Discord, and Telegram approval delivery exists, including authorization checks, callback deduplication, user capability tiers, rate limits, and lifecycle updates.
- **Durable protected audit records:** Protected events such as approvals, denials, pauses, provider secret changes, MCP activity, governance events, and coder transitions can be written to durable JSONL audit envelopes.
- **Tenant-scoped protected audit:** `/audit/stream` provides an admin-gated newline-delimited JSON feed for approval decisions, tool ledger events, and channel capability changes. Explicit tenant reads fail closed across tenant boundaries, and protected action/tool-effect events carry tenant context.
- **Protected audit ledger and evidence export:** Policy decisions, protected audit records, tool-effect ledger entries, and context-run journals can be tied together for governance evidence export.
- **MCP secret tenant checks:** MCP store secret references validate against tenant context before resolution.
- **Per-task tool and MCP policy:** Automation V2 nodes support step-level built-in tool and MCP connector scoping.
- **Runtime policy decision store:** Governed runtime decisions can be persisted and queried with tenant/run filtering through governance policy-decision surfaces.
- **Initial intra-tenant authority graph:** Direct grants, org-unit membership, role-domain nesting, inherited membership, explicit deny, and fail-closed no-grant decisions are modeled for runtime authorization.
- **Declarative approval gate matrix:** Risk tier and data class map to allow, deny, or approval-required outcomes with reviewer eligibility and approval TTL.
- **Cross-tenant grant contract:** Governed tenant-to-tenant sharing has signed grant envelopes, server/API surfaces, and positive sharing eval coverage; ordinary cross-tenant access remains denied unless an explicit grant applies.
- **Memory retrieval and encryption hardening:** Retrieval gateways govern memory/knowledge egress, memory promotion is policy-visible, local encrypted memory can store encryptable payloads as ciphertext, hosted KMS mode fails closed until configured, and hosted/enterprise or verifier-key-configured runtimes activate strict tenant memory/context policy before prompt assembly.
- **Action Firewall and egress preflight:** Protected actions and agent-team outbound effects can be evaluated before execution/egress.
- **Context hygiene guardrails:** Provider-facing context assembly emits budget telemetry, Full-context mode has fail-closed hard limits, and long-session evals assert provenance instead of only answer text.
- **Runtime artifacts and validation:** Runs can persist artifacts with validation metadata and expose them through runtime/debugging surfaces.
- **Evaluation framework:** The server includes AI failure taxonomy, eval datasets, an eval runner, regression thresholds, and quality-assurance documentation.

## In Progress

- **EnterpriseManager:** Runtime mode handling for `disabled`, `optional`, and `required` enterprise operation.
- **Fail-closed required mode:** Protected paths should block if enterprise is configured as required and the bridge is unavailable.
- **Bridge handshake:** Version negotiation, runtime instance identity, boot nonce, and sidecar capability discovery.
- **Capability negotiation:** Shared capability families for identity resolution, tenant resolution, policy authorization, token introspection, and audit append.
- **Status split:** Public-safe enterprise summary separate from admin-only diagnostics.
- **Tenant propagation audits:** Continued verification that sessions, automations, runs, artifacts, approvals, queues, memory, caches, logs, event streams, and exports are tenant-scoped.
- **Provider ACL sync and hosted identity integration:** Runtime grants currently model Tandem authority; upstream provider ACL sync and hosted identity lifecycle remain private control-plane work.

## Planned

- **Private enterprise sidecar:** Identity, tenancy, policy, audit, and governance implementation outside the OSS engine.
- **OIDC and SSO:** Enterprise identity integration in the private control plane/sidecar layer.
- **SCIM:** User and group provisioning for enterprise directories.
- **Turnkey SIEM integrations:** Splunk, Elastic, Datadog, or compatible managed audit export paths with connector-level retry/backpressure behavior.
- **Self-hosted enterprise license:** Commercial packaging around the public runtime plus private enterprise sidecar.
- **SOC2 and security package:** External audit, security one-pager, threat model, DPA, SLA, and procurement materials.
- **Fleet/control-plane separation:** Longer-term split between a runtime-local sidecar and enterprise admin/control-plane services.

## Current Enterprise Claim

Tandem can honestly claim a serious enterprise authority path today:

> The public runtime already carries the primitives enterprise AI work needs: durable runs, tenant-aware records, scoped tools, governed approval gates, initial policy decisions, intra-tenant authority modeling, explicit cross-tenant grant contracts, artifact validation, retrieval/egress controls, protected audit events, protected audit export foundations, and a sidecar-ready contract. Full enterprise identity, hosted RBAC administration, OIDC, SCIM, turnkey SIEM integrations, private sidecar enforcement, and SOC2 are roadmap items, not shipped guarantees.

Approval gates are runtime control points, not a complete enterprise identity boundary by themselves. For regulated or customer-impacting actions, Tandem should fail closed unless the runtime can verify tenant, policy, approval, proposed-action identity, and capability evidence at the protected tool call. Tandem now has an approval-receipt verifier, a policy decision store, a gate matrix, and protected audit evidence for governed tool calls; enterprise required-mode sidecar enforcement remains roadmap work.

## Fintech Readiness Note

Fintech compliance and risk operations are a strong proof-sprint fit for Tandem because they need cited artifacts, scoped connectors, protected approvals, tenant-aware records, and replayable audit evidence. A credible first demo is a compliance/risk update brief that reads selected sources, drafts a cited artifact, flags limitations, and pauses before any external or customer-impacting action.

This is not a claim that Tandem is production-ready for regulated fintech deployment. `fintech_strict` is an internal runtime profile marker, not mandatory isolation on its own. Autonomous money movement, account freezes, customer approval, regulatory filings, credit decisions, and risk-rating changes require runtime-verified protected approval/policy evidence and stronger enterprise gates. Required enterprise mode, private sidecar enforcement, OIDC, SCIM, turnkey SIEM integrations, hosted RBAC administration, and SOC2 remain in progress or planned as described above.
