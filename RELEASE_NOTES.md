# Release Notes

This is the canonical release-notes file used by release tooling.

## v0.5.9 (Unreleased)

Tandem 0.5.9 continues the hosted tenant-isolation work for Automation V2. The
focus is denial-driven hardening for background and applied automation paths:
scheduled runs, watch-triggered runs, stale recovery, imported/applied
definitions, Automation V2 event visibility, runtime route isolation, provider
and MCP credential boundaries, vector-backed memory partitioning, and the first
coder artifact tenant boundary. The current unreleased work also starts the
workspace access-control contract layer for Google Workspace-style company data
and resource grants.

### Enterprise Workspace Access Control

- Added public enterprise contract vocabulary for organization/workspace/
  department/project/resource hierarchies: `ResourceKind`,
  `ResourcePathSegment`, `ResourceRef`, and `ResourceScope`.
- Added access-control vocabulary for `View`, `Read`, `Edit`, `Execute`,
  `Delegate`, and `Admin`, plus data classes such as executive, credential,
  source-code, customer-data, and financial-record scopes.
- Added normalized principal references for humans, groups, departments, agent
  workers, automations, service accounts, external delegates, and support
  operators.
- Added `GrantSource` and `ScopedGrant` so access can be attributed to direct
  assignment, group membership, department membership, inherited grants,
  explicit executive/global grants, delegated projections, or break-glass
  authority.
- Added `StrictTenantContext`, `DataBoundary`, and `AssertionMetadata` as the
  additive strict context object for hosted/enterprise projections over tenant
  context, principals, authority chains, resource scopes, grants, data-class
  boundaries, and signed assertion metadata.
- Added allow/deny grant effects, structured access decisions, and
  `StrictTenantContext` evaluation helpers so explicit denies win over
  inherited allows, projected resource scopes bound access, expired grants do
  not apply, and project grants can authorize path-scoped resources.
- Extended Tandem context assertion claims with optional principal,
  resource-scope, scoped-grant, and data-boundary projection fields. Existing
  tenant-only v1 assertions remain valid and deserialize without strict
  projection data.
- Added a typed enterprise signing-key purpose vocabulary for context
  assertions, approval receipts, delegation projections, A2A peer assertions,
  and break-glass/admin assertions.
- Added hosted context assertion key metadata checks so keyring entries can
  bind a public key to the `context_assertion` purpose, org/deployment,
  allowed audiences, allowed resource-scope prefixes, activation windows, and
  active status while preserving legacy string and delimited key formats.
- Re-exported the new contract vocabulary through `tandem-types`.
- Added contract tests covering Finance department data access, Engineering
  repository path scopes, cross-functional group access, CEO org-wide executive
  grants, MCP tool resource targets, expiring delegated vendor-agent access,
  data-boundary denials, project-scoped agent projections, explicit deny
  precedence, expired grants, narrow delegation, scoped assertion projections,
  and legacy assertion compatibility.

### Hosted Runtime Ingress

- Hosted and enterprise runtime modes now require a configured deployment
  transport token before accepting requests.
- Verified hosted context assertions must carry explicit deployment-scoped
  tenant context rather than `local_implicit`.
- Context assertion verification now rejects authority chains whose initiating
  actor does not match the signed human actor.
- Request principals derived from signed context now use the verified assertion
  issuer as their source, preserving the Tandem control-plane trust boundary.

### Automation V2 Tenant Isolation

- Workflow planner apply, mission builder apply, and channel automation draft
  confirm now stamp persisted Automation V2 definitions from the request
  `TenantContext`.
- Automation V2 create/apply payloads cannot switch tenant context through
  embedded metadata.
- Scheduled/background-created runs inherit the stored automation tenant.
- Watch-condition runs now inherit the owning automation tenant instead of
  falling back to `local_implicit`.
- Automation V2 context-run blackboard sync inherits the run tenant, so
  background-created context runs do not silently become local implicit.
- Stale reaping and auto-resume regression coverage now proves explicit run
  tenant context survives recovery without an active HTTP request.
- Scheduler-published Automation V2 run-created events now include top-level
  `tenantContext`, allowing hosted/global SSE filters to enforce tenant
  visibility.
- Added finite-body Automation V2 SSE coverage proving a tenant stream receives
  its own event and does not receive another tenant's event.

### Runtime Tenant Isolation

- Session routes now enforce tenant ownership for list, get, delete, messages,
  prompting, attach, and workspace-override flows.
- Global event streams filter emitted events by tenant context so hosted
  tenants do not receive unrelated runtime events.
- Context-run internal routes are hardened by tenant for events/SSE, blackboard
  access, task claim/transition, checkpoints, replay, and ledger state.
- Automation V2 run/gate routes reject cross-tenant list, mutation, start,
  inspect, approve, deny, and rework attempts.
- Legacy workflow routes gained tenant checks so older governance-light paths
  cannot become a bypass around Automation V2 isolation.
- Coder-created context runs now inherit the request tenant, and coder
  status/list/get/artifact reads are filtered through the linked context run
  tenant.
- Coder control and artifact-writing routes now require the caller to match the
  owning context run tenant before approving, cancelling, executing, writing
  artifacts, or listing memory candidates. Added denial coverage proving tenant
  B cannot mutate or inspect tenant A's coder run through those routes.

### Provider And MCP Secrets

- Provider credential records are tenant-scoped for hosted/shared runtime mode.
- Provider create/list/read/update/delete/refresh paths use the request tenant
  and fail closed across tenant boundaries.
- Store-backed MCP secret references validate tenant scope before lookup.
- MCP tool execution now receives effective request/session/run tenant context
  so tenant A cannot execute with tenant B's stored MCP secret.
- Local single-tenant env/store secret behavior is preserved for local mode.

### Memory Isolation

- Governed memory search, list, read, promote, demote, update, and delete paths
  use tenant-aware DB methods.
- `memory_records` dedupe and user-created indexes now include tenant scope.
- Vector-backed session/project/global memory chunks now store tenant
  org/workspace/deployment scope.
- sqlite-vec top-k memory search filters the chunk table by tenant before
  distance ranking, preventing another tenant's closer vectors from suppressing
  the current tenant's results.
- Added denial tests for identical vector content, shared source hashes,
  cross-tenant vector search, cross-tenant vector deletes, tenant-scoped memory
  stats, project vector stats, manual clear, and old-session cleanup.
- Memory manager context retrieval now has tenant-aware APIs that scope recent
  session chunks and vector search before prompt context is assembled.
- Memory file import/index paths now carry tenant scope through import
  requests, index lookup/update/delete, stale file chunk replacement,
  sync-delete cleanup, project file-index stats, and project file-index clear.
- Added denial tests proving same project/path imports, identical file chunks,
  index deletes, stats, and clears do not cross tenant boundaries.
- Memory project/global config rows and old-session hygiene now use tenant
  scope, with tests proving same project ids cannot overwrite retention policy
  or prune another tenant's session memory.
- Knowledge spaces now include tenant-scoped uniqueness, and knowledge item,
  coverage, promotion, manager, and Automation V2 preflight paths use
  tenant-aware lookups so curated knowledge cannot cross hosted tenant
  boundaries.
- Existing local memory rows default to `local/local` during migration.

### Automation V2 MCP Diagnostics

- Required MCP tool validation now reports the exact missing tool ids in
  `missing_required_mcp_tools` and in `required_next_tool_actions`, making
  repair prompts specific instead of saying only that required MCP calls were
  incomplete.
- MCP connector results that return string errors such as `MCP error -32602`
  are now treated as failed tool results, so invalid connector arguments do not
  satisfy required-tool validation.
- Structured JSON nodes that declare `output_contract.schema` now validate the
  final artifact against that schema, so raw MCP account/quota/search payloads
  cannot pass as completed handoff artifacts.
- Automation V2 node preflight now derives concise MCP tool contracts from the
  offered tool schemas, including required arguments, minimal examples, and
  non-blocking schema warnings that are injected into prompts and diagnostics.
- MCP contract examples now respect positive `minLength` constraints for
  required string fields, preventing invalid empty-string examples for tools
  such as Notion search.
- Structured connector nodes now short-circuit across empty batch, empty
  candidate, empty high-value-contact, and empty write-row handoffs, writing the
  appropriate empty artifact instead of spending calls on account, inventory,
  enrichment, or write checks.
- Automation blocker panels now read checkpoint lifecycle history in addition
  to node outputs and event streams, surfacing node repair and run pause
  reasons that were previously hidden behind generic blocked status.

### Compatibility

- Local/default single-tenant behavior remains unchanged.
- This release does not start Zitadel/OIDC, SCIM, private sidecar, broader
  artifact isolation, or audit-export isolation work.
- File import/index isolation, governed knowledge-memory isolation, and broader
  memory-derived cache hardening remain follow-up work.

## v0.5.8 (2026-05-17)

Tandem 0.5.8 begins the enterprise auth, tenant context, and execution-time
verification implementation. This is the first runtime-facing slice: it adds
provider-agnostic tenant-context contract types and starts carrying tenant
context into tool policy evaluation, while preserving local and single-tenant
behavior by default.

### Enterprise Tenant Context Foundation

- Added explicit runtime auth-mode names for local single-tenant,
  hosted single-tenant, and enterprise-required operation.
- Added canonical parsing and operator-friendly aliases for the runtime auth
  modes, with `TANDEM_RUNTIME_AUTH_MODE` resolving to local single-tenant by
  default.
- Extended the enterprise contract with human actor metadata, deployment-aware
  tenant context, verified tenant-context assertion metadata, hosted tenant
  constructors, authenticated request principals, and request authority-chain
  helpers.
- Added provider-agnostic tenant context assertion header and claims types for
  the future Tandem-signed JWS passed from `tandem-web` to runtime/ACA.
- Re-exported the new contract types through `tandem-types` for runtime and
  server consumers.
- Added runtime verification for compact Tandem context assertions signed with
  Ed25519, including public-key configuration, issuer/audience checks, expiry
  checks, and tamper rejection in hosted and enterprise auth modes.
- Added `kid`-based context assertion keyring support through
  `TANDEM_CONTEXT_ASSERTION_PUBLIC_KEYS` / `_FILE`, with JSON object keyrings
  preferred and the existing single-key env vars preserved as fallback.
- Added hosted control-plane signer prep in `tandem-web`: a provider-neutral
  context assertion signer shape, local Ed25519 test signer, and Google Cloud
  KMS Software Ed25519 adapter for future hosted assertions.

### Runtime Policy Plumbing

- `ToolPolicyContext` now carries the session tenant context into runtime tool
  policy hooks.
- The engine loop loads the current session tenant before evaluating policy for
  a tool call.
- Hosted and enterprise runtime auth modes now reject raw tenant/actor headers
  and fail closed unless a configured Tandem-signed context assertion verifies.
- Verified hosted assertions are attached to request extensions alongside the
  derived tenant context and request principal, giving downstream runtime code a
  trustworthy identity object to consume in later sprints.
- Fintech strict protected-tool policy now rejects execution when the session
  tenant context does not match the owning Automation V2 run tenant context.
- In hosted and enterprise auth modes, fintech strict protected tools now fail
  closed if execution reaches the policy hook without a non-local tenant context
  and human actor.
- Sessions now persist verified tenant assertion metadata and pass it into
  `ToolPolicyContext`, so strict protected-tool policy can reject expired signed
  tenant assertions at execution time instead of trusting only the original HTTP
  ingress decision.
- Added regression coverage proving local/default session creation still works
  without hosted auth headers or signed context assertions.

### Coder Reliability Upgrade

Tandem Coder now behaves more like a coding supervisor than a generic prompt
runner. Issue-fix work is scheduled as real implementation work, runs in a
managed worktree, requires evidence of code changes and validation, and hands
off through a PR instead of marking project work as done prematurely.

- Issue-fix worker sessions now use a dedicated coding contract: inspect the
  repository, read scoped instructions, make a plan, patch files, run
  validation, repair failures where possible, and report concise evidence.
- Strict tool/write enforcement is applied to issue-fix workers, including
  prewrite inspection requirements before mutation. Non-issue-fix worker types
  such as triage, review, and merge recommendation keep their existing
  non-writing execution mode.
- Managed worktrees are preserved until handoff completes, allowing Tandem to
  collect and expose `git diff`, changed files, validation output, branch name,
  commit SHA, PR URL, and completion-gate evidence.
- Completion is now gated: no patch blocks completion, failed validation blocks
  completion, failed push/PR handoff blocks completion, and successful PR
  creation moves the GitHub Project item to Review rather than fake Done.
- Coder run records now include worker/session ids, worker run ids, managed
  worktree paths, branch/commit/PR metadata, changed files, validation status,
  handoff status, and completion-gate details.
- Project policy now defaults to PR-required handoff, native Tandem delegation,
  max two parallel issue runs, and no manual out-of-order runs unless the
  project explicitly opts in.
- GitHub Project intake payloads now include scheduler explanations: parent
  cards, phase, blockers, scheduler rank, runnable state, active run id, run
  state, and handoff URL.
- Parent cards are treated as planning/grouping headers only. The scheduler
  launches child issues by the lowest open phase and dependency order.

### Coder Control Panel

- The Coder intake view now renders as the primary board: TODO, In Progress,
  Blocked, Review, and Done columns with parent/phase grouping, next-runnable
  badges, disabled run buttons with reasons, and handoff links.
- `Run scheduler next` launches only the lowest open phase's scheduler-approved
  child issues. `Run selected` stays disabled for out-of-order work unless the
  project policy enables manual override.
- The board shows Tandem's spinner while GitHub Project sync is active instead
  of leaving the intake area visually blank.
- Active run payloads now carry enough status for the control panel to show the
  current worker session, latest action/log context, changed files, validation
  output, branch, PR link, and failure reason using the existing coder routes
  and event streams.

### Boundaries

- This release does not add Zitadel integration yet.
- `tandem-agents` still does not depend on Zitadel or raw IdP tokens.
- `tandem-web` is the intended owner of Tandem-signed hosted context
  assertions; runtime and ACA should consume Tandem assertions/public keyrings,
  not raw Zitadel or Google identity tokens.
- Hosted strict auth is not enabled by default.
- Local, desktop, and single-tenant workflows continue to run without hosted
  auth, signed context assertions, or approval signing keys.
- GitHub Project `Done` remains a post-review/merge state. Coder implementation
  handoff now stops at Review with a PR link and evidence.

### Versioning

- Rust crates, npm packages, Python client metadata, Tauri config, and lockfiles
  are bumped to `0.5.8`.

## v0.5.7 (2026-05-17)

Tandem 0.5.7 moves the project positioning and first domain-specific runtime hardening toward governed AI infrastructure for enterprise work. The release adds public enterprise runtime docs, a fintech strict-mode foundation for compliance and risk workflows, and the first runtime evidence paths needed to prove that Tandem can govern long-running AI work with scoped tools, citations, approvals, artifacts, audit events, and replayable run records. It also restructures the desktop Coder workspace so the live state of running work is visible at a glance.

### Enterprise Runtime Infrastructure Positioning

- The README now opens with Tandem as governed AI runtime infrastructure for long-running agentic work.
- `docs/AI_RUNTIME_INFRASTRUCTURE.md` explains the runtime model: engine-owned state, canonical run journal, task graph, tool/MCP policy, approvals, validators, artifacts, receipts, replay, and enterprise sidecar boundaries.
- `docs/ENTERPRISE_READINESS.md` separates what is available now from in-progress and planned enterprise capabilities.
- `docs/ENTERPRISE_PROOF_WALKTHROUGH.md` gives platform engineers a repo-grounded path for verifying one governed run from intent through plan, scoped tools, approval, artifact validation, audit evidence, and replay/debug.

### Fintech Strict Runtime Foundation

This release adds an internal `fintech_strict` profile marker for Automation V2 metadata. It is aimed at compliance and risk operations proof sprints, especially compliance/risk update briefs.

What ships now:

- A protected fintech action classifier in `tandem-core` for account actions, customer communications, regulatory filings, system-of-record updates, credit decisions, money movement, and evidence publication.
- Server tool-policy hook enforcement for fintech strict Automation V2 sessions.
- Protected fintech tools and unknown external mutation tools are blocked with clear denial reasons until an approval path is used.
- Denied protected fintech actions emit runtime events and protected audit records.
- `/audit/stream` maps fintech protected-action denials and verified approvals into admin-readable audit rows.
- Mission runtime projection ignores `metadata.approval.skip_approval` for fintech strict nodes, so UI/planner metadata cannot suppress injected approval gates for fintech strict work.
- Protected fintech tool denials now fail closed with explicit call-site approval/policy verifier status in the denial reason and protected audit payload.
- Automation gate decisions can now carry protected-action metadata, and fintech strict protected tools are allowed only when a matching approved receipt proves tenant, category, tool, action hash, and non-expired approval at execution time.

### Evidence, Citations, And Audit Packages

- Tool effect ledger summaries now preserve safe source identifiers such as `source_id`, `document_id`, `ticket_id`, and `record_id`, while still avoiding raw query text.
- Connector proof helpers only accept successful source retrieval calls as evidence; connector discovery/listing alone is not enough.
- Existing context-run ledger summaries now include `fintech_connector_proof` derived from successful source retrieval tool records.
- Compliance/risk brief validation checks required fields, citations, limitations, reviewer status, approval state, and audit IDs.
- Explicitly marked fintech brief workflow nodes persist connector proof and validation results in artifact validation metadata, and reject citations that cannot be mapped to connector proof.
- Workflow plans that explicitly ask for fintech compliance/risk brief artifacts now materialize with `fintech_strict` runtime metadata and artifact markers by default; generic finance workflows are left alone.
- An internal audit package helper can assemble run, tenant, actor, tool calls, connector proof, artifacts, approvals, and policy decisions from Automation V2 run state.
- The assembled fintech audit package can be persisted as a context-run artifact for compliance-review handoff.
- `eval_datasets/fintech_compliance_risk.yaml` adds proof-sprint fixtures for unsupported claim rejection, connector selected-but-unused rejection, protected-action bypass attempts, cross-tenant source denial, and incomplete evidence surfaced as limitations.
- Eval runner spec mapping now carries fintech runtime profile, tenant, and artifact-contract metadata into generated Automation V2 specs for stub/live evals.

### Coder Workspace UX

The desktop Coder panel was rebuilt so the state of running work is visible at a glance and the intake flow is no longer dominated by setup chrome. The previous panel showed task status as a tiny outlined pill in the corner of each card, hid awaiting-approval prompts inside a tab, duplicated the project picker between a stat box and a separate card, and kept the GitHub Project intake fully expanded even after a binding was saved. The redesigned layout makes "what's running, what needs me, what failed" the dominant signal and reduces the amount of scrolling needed before a coding swarm is launched or inspected.

- **Live status badges with animated indicators**: New `CoderRunStatusBadge` renders run status as colored chips — `Running` (primary spinner + pulse dot), `Queued` (primary pulse), `Needs approval` (amber + pulse), `Paused` (amber), `Failed` (red), `Cancelled` (muted), `Completed` (emerald). Used on every run card in the list and at the top of the run detail card so the running/queued/awaiting state is the first thing the eye lands on. A run's status tone now also drives the color of the progress bar (amber when paused or awaiting, red on failure, emerald on completion, primary while running).

- **Always-visible runs summary strip**: New `CoderRunsSummary` component at the top of the Runs view tallies Running / Needs approval / Paused / Failed / Completed across the workspace and shows a live "Updated Xs ago" indicator that ticks every 15 seconds (so the relative time stays fresh between sidecar event-driven refreshes). The summary surfaces totals even when individual runs scroll off-screen and emphasizes attention categories so they remain visible at a consistent spot.

- **Step progress on every card and the detail header**: New `CoderRunProgress` component draws a thin progress bar plus `completed / total` (and blocked) counts derived from each run's checkpoint node IDs. The bar appears on each list card under the status banner and at the top of the detail card next to the status badge, so a run's actual position in its workflow is visible without expanding the Context tab.

- **Elevated awaiting-gate prompts**: When a run is waiting on an operator decision, the detail card now shows the prompt title, instructions, and `Approve & continue` / `Request rework` buttons in an amber alert at the very top of the card — above the action toolbar — instead of in the Overview tab's "Gate State" panel. List cards for awaiting runs grow a matching amber "Waiting on you: …" banner so the same signal is visible in the list without selecting the run.

- **Consolidated project context header**: The Coder page header now embeds `ProjectSwitcher` directly and shows the detected git slug / current branch / default branch as a subtitle (with a short "Detecting git repo…" hint while resolution is in flight). The previous "Active Project" stat box, the standalone "Project Context" card, and the four-stat "User Repo Context" card are gone — the same information is in one place, taking ~1/4 the vertical space.

- **Tab pills with attention counts and smart default tab**: The Create / Runs tabs are now accent-pill buttons. The Runs tab shows a badge with the count of active or failed runs and switches to an amber tone when any run needs approval (red when any failed) so the operator can spot work that needs them from the Create tab. On first load, the page auto-defaults to Runs when the workspace has any active runs and stays on Create otherwise, instead of always landing on Create.

- **Collapsing GitHub Project intake**: GitHub Project binding and inbox UX moved into a dedicated `CoderGithubProjectPanel` component. When no project is bound, the connect form (Owner + Project Number + Connect) is the only thing in the card. Once bound, the configuration collapses to a single-line `Connected · owner #N` summary with `Refresh` and `Change` buttons, and status mapping (TODO / In Progress / In Review / Blocked / Done) plus saved/live schema fingerprints move behind an "Advanced" disclosure that is closed by default. Inbox items render in a tighter row layout with linked issue numbers and the primary action reads `Pull into Coder`.

- **Dev-noise sections removed**: The "First Slice" and "Compatibility" stat boxes from the original Coder header card, the "Selected preset … is UI scaffolding in this slice" copy under the Mission Builder, and the always-open `DeveloperRunViewer` ("Legacy Compatibility") at the bottom of the Runs view are all gone. The legacy inspector now lives behind a collapsed "Legacy coder inspector" disclosure so it is one click away when needed but no longer dominates the Runs view.

The Coder restructure is pure UI: no changes to the `tandem-agents` API surface, the Tauri command surface, the Automation V2 contract, the coder metadata schema, or the GitHub Project MCP tools. Saved coder templates, saved GitHub Project bindings, and the existing run detail tabs (Overview, Transcripts, Context, Artifacts, Memory) continue to work unchanged. Internally, new shared helpers (`runStatusTone`, `runIsActive`, `runProgress`, `relativeTimeFromMs`) in `coderRunUtils.ts` let the list, detail, summary, and progress components classify status through one code path.

### Boundaries

- No public HTTP API changes were added for fintech strict mode.
- This is not a production-ready regulated fintech deployment claim.
- `fintech_strict` is an internal profile marker, not mandatory isolation by itself.
- Approval gates are runtime control points, not complete authorization; regulated protected-tool execution should fail closed unless the runtime verifies matching policy/approval evidence at call time.
- Automatic protected-action approval routing, persisted fintech audit exports, OIDC, SCIM, SIEM export, SOC2, full RBAC, and private sidecar enforcement remain follow-up work.

### Versioning

- Rust crates, npm packages, Python client metadata, Tauri config, and lockfiles are bumped to `0.5.7`.

## v0.5.6 (2026-05-14)

### AI Evaluation Framework

This release ships the complete AI Evaluation Framework (Phases 1-5): a production-ready system for structured testing, regression detection, and compliance documentation of AI quality. The framework enables automated quality gates that prevent AI performance regressions from reaching production, provide quantitative proof of AI safety practices for compliance audits (e.g., EU AI Act Article 50 transparency), and make it easy for teams to experiment with new AI features while maintaining quality baseline.

**What ships now:**

- **Failure Mode Taxonomy** (`AIFailureMode` enum with 30+ variants): Formalized categorization of AI failures across validation (artifact validation, contract violations, citation missing, web sources missing), provider (timeout, rate limit, model not found, stream failures), repair (budget exhausted, loop detection, unavailable), resource (token exhausted, cost exhausted, memory exhausted), authorization (failed, invalid API key, permission denied), and system-level (config error, dependency missing, feature disabled) domains. Each failure is classified into a severity category (Critical, High, Medium, Low) for incident response prioritization. Includes deterministic classifiers (`classify_error_text()`, `categorize_failure()`, `should_retry()`) for automatically tagging failures from real error text.

- **Evaluation Dataset Format** (YAML/JSON): Structured `EvalDataset` schema with `EvalTestCase` definitions, `AutomationSpecTest` node specifications, and configurable `EvalExpectedOutput` validation criteria. Four example datasets ship in `eval_datasets/`: **critical_path.yaml** (happy-path scenarios for core features), **provider_failures.yaml** (resilience tests for timeouts and rate limits), **repair_exhaustion.yaml** (budget depletion edge cases), and **citation_validation.yaml** (web research validation). Dataset format is version-controlled and extensible for adding new test scenarios.

- **Eval Runner CLI** (`cargo run --bin eval-runner`): Standalone command-line tool for bulk test execution with the following capabilities:
  - **Metrics aggregation**: Computes pass_rate, avg_repair_iterations, total_cost_usd, avg_cost_per_test, provider_failure_rate, and per-validator-class pass rates from test results
  - **Simulation mode** (`--simulation`): Deterministic test execution without making AI provider calls, making evals safe to run in CI and cost-free during development
  - **Parallel workers** (`--num-workers`): Configurable parallelism for faster test suite runs
  - **Tag filtering** (`--filter-tag`): Run only tests matching a specific tag (e.g., `regression`, `happy_path`)
  - **CLI arguments**: `--dataset` (required), `--output`, `--provider`, `--model`, `--max-duration`, `--verbose`
  - **Output format**: Human-readable summary on stdout + structured JSON to file for programmatic CI consumption
  - **Exit codes**: 0 (all tests passed), 1 (one or more test failures), 2 (dataset load error or invalid arguments)

- **Regression Detection System**: Baseline comparison infrastructure that prevents AI quality degradation. `EvalBaseline` stores snapshots of evaluation metrics with git commit/branch metadata. `detect_regressions()` function compares current run metrics against a saved baseline using configurable thresholds (default: 5 percentage point pass_rate drop, 20% cost increase, 30% repair iteration increase, 5 percentage point provider failure increase). Results are reported as `RegressionStatus` (Pass / Warning / Regression) with human-readable messages explaining the deltas.

- **Regression Detection CI Gate** (`.github/workflows/eval-regression-gate.yml`): GitHub Actions workflow that:
  - Triggers on every PR against main/develop and on main branch pushes
  - Builds and runs `eval-runner` against critical_path.yaml dataset
  - Compares results to eval_baselines/main_branch.json baseline
  - Posts a summary comment on the PR with pass rate and test counts
  - **Fails the check** if any regression threshold is exceeded (protecting main from quality degradation)
  - **Auto-updates the baseline** on successful main branch push so future PR comparisons use the latest production metrics
  - Uploads eval results as CI artifact for debugging and audit trail

- **Developer Documentation** (`docs/dev/EVAL_FRAMEWORK.md`, ~500 lines): Comprehensive guide including:
  - Quick start with CLI examples
  - Architecture overview and data flow diagrams
  - Step-by-step guide for adding new eval datasets
  - Threshold customization patterns
  - Failure mode taxonomy reference
  - Running tests locally and in CI
  - Troubleshooting common issues (model differences, rate limits, nondeterminism)
  - FAQ covering simulation mode, parallelization, validators, costs, baseline updates

- **User & Compliance Documentation** (`docs/user/AI_QUALITY_ASSURANCE.md`, ~350 lines): Non-technical guide covering:
  - **Core quality metrics** explained for end users (pass rate, repair iterations, cost, provider reliability)
  - **Test scenarios** described (happy path, edge cases, regression tests)
  - **Quality assurance process** (automated regression detection, continuous monitoring, failure analysis)
  - **EU AI Act Article 50 compliance**: Explicit mapping of Tandem's testing practices to transparency requirements for natural persons interacting with the AI system
  - **Trust model**: What Tandem can and cannot guarantee, limitations of AI systems
  - **Incident response**: How issues are detected, investigated, and resolved
  - **Support contacts** and glossary

### Quality Gate Features

The regression-detection workflow is designed to be **low-friction and CI-friendly**:

- Default thresholds are conservative but tunable per team/metric
- Simulation mode means evaluations complete in seconds with zero API cost
- Pass/Warning/Regression statuses provide clear go/no-go signals for CI gates
- JSON output integrates with custom CI/CD tooling for advanced use cases
- PR comments make quality trends visible to the whole team

### EU AI Act Article 50 Compliance

This framework explicitly supports Article 50 transparency obligations for hosted Tandem services:

- ✅ **Documented AI system**: The framework demonstrates how AI components are systematically tested
- ✅ **Quality assurance**: Automated gates and metrics prove ongoing quality practices
- ✅ **Failure categorization**: 30+ failure types enable post-mortem root-cause analysis
- ✅ **Performance tracking**: Metrics track AI quality before, during, and after deployment
- ✅ **Regression prevention**: Automated safeguards block degradations from reaching users
- ✅ **Audit trail**: All test results are timestamped and logged for compliance audits

Users and auditors can request detailed evaluation metrics, regression reports, and failure analysis logs via support channels.

---

### Security

- **Authorization fix for approval gates**: Slack, Discord, and Telegram approval interactions now fail closed unless the acting user resolves through the configured channel allowlist before approval, rework, or cancel decisions are processed.

- **TOCTOU race condition fix in automation run cache**: Automation run state reloads now detect concurrent in-memory updates before accepting disk-loaded state, preventing stale cache loads from overwriting gate decisions or duplicating execution.

- **Path traversal protection for automation identifiers**: Automation definition and run-history paths now sanitize identifier-derived filenames and verify resolved paths stay inside their intended state roots.

- **Dedup TTL for webhook replay prevention**: Discord and Slack interaction deduplication now uses a bounded retry window, reducing stale replay risk while preserving normal platform retry handling.

- **File permission validation on startup**: Startup now warns when sensitive state files have overly broad Unix permissions so operators can tighten local storage access.

- **Discord modal identifier validation**: Discord rework modal submissions now reject malformed or incomplete identifiers before any gate decision is dispatched.

- **Telegram dedup TTL implementation**: Telegram approval callbacks now use the same retry-window deduplication model as Discord and Slack, reducing stale callback replay risk.

- **User ID extraction: reject instead of default**: Channel approval handlers now reject malformed requests without a resolvable acting user instead of assigning a placeholder identity.

- **Reason field size validation**: Discord rework feedback is now bounded server-side before being stored with gate decisions.

- **Error message information disclosure prevention**: Public channel rejection messages now use generic denial text while retaining detailed audit logs for operators.

- **JWT structure and algorithm validation**: Codex identity token parsing now validates token shape, header presence, allowed algorithm behavior, and signature encoding before processing claims.

- **JSON merge recursion depth limit**: Provider configuration merging now enforces a maximum nesting depth to avoid stack exhaustion on deeply nested input.

- **CODEX_HOME path validation**: Codex CLI home resolution now rejects unsafe or system-sensitive paths and falls back to the default home directory with a warning.

- **JWT token expiration validation**: Codex identity resolution now rejects tokens without valid expiration claims and bounds-checks expiration timestamps before time arithmetic.

- **Approval card delivery fan-out**: Slack, Discord, and Telegram channel adapters now support native interactive card sends. Approval requests can render as Block Kit messages, Discord embeds with components, or Telegram inline-keyboard messages instead of plain text fallbacks.

- **Slack approval card lifecycle updates**: The server records delivered approval message handles in `approval_message_map.json` and best-effort edits Slack approval cards after approve, rework, or cancel decisions so stale buttons disappear and operators see the final decision inline.

- **Shared automation gate state helpers**: Automation V2 gate pause and decision mutations now route through shared state helpers. The executor uses `pause_automation_run_for_gate` when an approval node blocks downstream work, and the gate-decision HTTP handler uses `apply_automation_gate_decision` for approve/rework/cancel state transitions, preserving the existing race-safe one-winner behavior.

- **Per-step approval override controls**: Workflow edit prompts now let operators keep default approval, set conditional auto-approval metadata, or skip approval for an individual step with confirmation. The saved node metadata drives the compiler's existing approval-skip hook and clears stale injected gates on skipped steps.

- **Telegram approval rework completion**: Telegram approval cards now prefer persisted opaque callback IDs so long run/node identifiers do not rely on unsafe truncation. Rework button taps send a force-reply prompt, capture the operator's next valid reply for that chat/user, and dispatch it as a `rework` gate decision with feedback.

- **Threaded approval status replies**: Slack, Discord, and Telegram adapters now share a thread-reply primitive. Approval decisions update the original card and post a short status reply into the stored native thread/topic target when one is available.

- **Channel command capability tiers**: Slash commands now carry read/act/approve/reconfigure tiers, and dispatcher execution checks the required tier against the channel security profile. Read contexts can inspect status without gaining approval or reconfiguration powers.

- **Persisted channel user capabilities**: Tandem now has `channel_user_capabilities.json` state for explicit per-channel user capability assignments. Missing users fall back to the channel profile tier until enrollment binds them to a higher tier.

- **Channel enrollment pairing codes**: `POST /channels/enroll` can issue a short-lived pairing code and confirm it out-of-band to bind a Slack, Discord, or Telegram user ID to a persisted capability tier. Approval button handlers now check the resolved user's tier and require `Approve` or higher before deciding a gate.

- **Channel outbound redaction**: Dispatcher replies now pass through a shared redaction filter before Slack, Discord, or Telegram sends. The filter replaces common secret patterns, private-key markers, JWTs, and absolute paths outside the workspace root while preserving markdown structure; deployments can add regexes with `TANDEM_CHANNEL_REDACTION_PATTERNS_FILE`.

- **Per-user channel rate limiting**: Tandem now applies per-user token buckets to channel-origin prompts and approval decisions. Prompts default to 10/minute, decisions default to 30/minute, limits are keyed by `(channel, user_id)`, profile-specific env overrides are supported, and rejected requests return `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After`.

- **Workspace pinning for channel sessions**: Channel sessions now carry a pinned workspace boundary. New channel-created sessions pin to the server workspace, enrollment records can preserve an explicit `pinned_workspace_id`, and file tools are denied with `ToolDenied { reason: WorkspaceScope }` if a channel session tries to read or write outside the pinned workspace.

- **Streaming audit export**: `GET /audit/stream` now exposes an admin-gated newline-delimited JSON feed for external SIEM-style consumers. The stream normalizes approval decisions, tool execution ledger records, and channel capability changes into records with actor, command, workspace, tool call, result, timestamp, and channel fields where available.

- **Step-up confirmation for channel reconfiguration**: Reconfigure-tier slash commands now require a fresh second-surface confirmation before execution. The dispatcher blocks `/providers`, `/model`, `/schedule`, `/automations`, and `/config` with a "step-up required" response unless the chat message carries a desktop-issued PIN from the last 5 minutes. The PIN token is removed before command parsing so it is not treated as a model id, schedule prompt, or config argument.

- **Dispatcher baseline cleanup**: Channel dispatcher tests now match the registry-driven help output and concrete operator tool allowlist behavior, keeping the approval-channel test suite aligned with the current dispatcher contract.

## v0.5.5 (2026-05-13)

This release lays down the **Execution Profiles** foundation — a runtime governance toggle (Strict / Guided / YOLO) that will let users keep working while validators and contracts continue to harden, without abandoning Tandem's runtime ownership of state, receipts, replay, spend tracking, and approvals. The motivation is operational: full governance still has a high run-fail rate as bugs are ironed out, and a meaningful share of those failures are over-strict (false-positive validation, missing-but-non-essential sections, recoverable artifact issues) rather than real defects. Execution Profiles are the structured bridge that lets affected runs continue with the relaxation captured in receipts, so the data we collect can drive validator classes back to Strict-by-default once they mature.

The v0.5.5 cut is **backend telemetry-only**. Strict, Guided, and YOLO runs all produce identical run outcomes today; the only difference is in receipts. This is intentional. The status-downgrade behavior change (where Guided actually warns instead of blocking, and YOLO actually continues as experimental) is gated on the next slice, which can calibrate against the validator-class telemetry collected here. No existing automation changes behavior in this release.

What ships now:

- **Type foundation** (`automation_v2::execution_profile`): `ExecutionProfile` enum (`strict`/`guided`/`yolo`), `ValidatorClass` taxonomy with `is_relaxable_in(profile)` and a conservative `is_critical()` allowlist for never-relaxable classes (auth, secret access, destructive-action approval, budget caps, kill switch, deterministic verifier failures). `decide_profile_validation` is the single chokepoint; `augment_output_with_profile_relaxation` is the executor-facing helper; `classify_unmet_requirement` maps existing validator strings to the taxonomy.
- **Run record and API**: `AutomationExecutionPolicy.profile` is now optional and persisted. Every `AutomationV2RunRecord` carries typed `effective_execution_profile` and `requested_execution_profile`. `POST /automations/v2/{id}/run_now` accepts an optional `execution_profile` override (Strict, Guided, or YOLO) that applies for the single run only without mutating the saved automation. `resolve_effective_execution_profile` enforces a deterministic precedence: run override → workflow policy → Strict.
- **Lifecycle and event observability**: `record_automation_lifecycle_event_with_metadata` automatically merges the run's `effective_execution_profile` into every `AutomationLifecycleRecord` so existing audit, replay, and Bug Monitor surfaces see the profile without per-call-site changes. The `automation_v2.run.failed` engine event now includes both `effective_execution_profile` and `requested_execution_profile`, so Bug Monitor and downstream observers can attribute failures to the active profile.
- **Executor chokepoint (telemetry-only)**: The executor invokes `augment_output_with_profile_relaxation` at the single run-acceptance moment. When every `unmet_requirement` on a node output is relaxable under the active profile, it writes `relaxed_validator_classes` (structured), `effective_outcome`, `original_validator_outcome`, `execution_profile`, and `experimental: true` (YOLO) into the `artifact_validation` block. Strict runs are unchanged. Critical classes (destructive-action approval, budget cap, etc.) always block; if any classification is unknown, the augmentation conservatively skips so behavior stays Strict-equivalent.
- **24 unit tests** covering serde round-trip, default-to-Strict, critical-class blocking, soft-class relaxation per profile, tenant-denylist enforcement, classifier mapping, augmentation purity, and lifecycle metadata merge semantics.

What is intentionally deferred to follow-up slices and tracked in `docs/internal/execution-profiles/KANBAN.md`:

- Phase 4b: status-downgrade behavior change so Guided actually warns and YOLO actually continues as experimental, gated on telemetry calibration.
- Phase 5: wiring the existing `effective_repair_budget` multiplier (1.0 / 1.5 / 2.0 by profile) into the repair-decision call sites.
- Phase 6: control-panel UI (profile selector, run pill, experimental badge).
- Phase 7: Tauri desktop UI (matching control panel).
- Experimental-input propagation rule for downstream nodes.
- Tenant-level relaxation denylist and default-profile administration.

This patch keeps automation-owned runtime sessions out of the user Chat session list without hiding their audit trail from the rest of Tandem.

Sessions now carry explicit source metadata. New interactive sessions default to `sourceKind: chat`, Automation V2/Bug Monitor worker sessions are classified as `automation_v2`, and session listing supports filtering by source. The TypeScript client and wire model expose the same fields so control-panel views can ask for the session class they actually need.

The Chat sidebar and Dashboard recent-session list now request only `source=chat`, so Bug Monitor submissions such as `Automation automation-v2-bug-monitor-triage-failure-draft-... / inspect_failure_report` no longer appear as conversations. Legacy automation records with the existing title format are classified at the storage/wire boundary, preserving backward compatibility for already-written sessions.

The Tauri desktop Automation Calendar no longer crashes the app while loading. FullCalendar is now isolated into its own lazy bundle and imported only after the WebKit stylesheet host is ready, preventing the `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'cssRules')` startup failure seen when opening the calendar view.

Bug Monitor GitHub issue creation now uses a persisted pending idempotency claim before calling GitHub. Completion finalization, stale-provider recovery, deadline recovery, and status-sweep recovery can all wake up around the same draft, but only the first caller that claims the create-issue digest is allowed to create the GitHub issue. Concurrent callers now see `publish_in_progress` or reuse the posted record instead of producing duplicate issues with the same fingerprint and triage run.

Bug Monitor proposal quality gates also recognize the structured handoff shapes that triage nodes actually return, including wrapped objects such as `{ "bug_monitor_inspection": ... }` and array responses containing the artifact followed by a compact status object. Placeholder task specs still fail the gate, but valid completed inspection, research, validation, and fix-proposal artifacts no longer get treated as missing and replaced with broad fallback evidence.

Bug Monitor triage status detection now treats nested `status: blocked` fields inside structured Bug Monitor handoffs as evidence/limitation data, not as the node's own runtime status. This prevents `propose_fix_and_verification` from recursively blocking the debugger when it has produced a useful partial fix proposal with acceptance criteria and bounded next steps.

Automation V2 long-running nodes now get to own their timeout path. The stale-run reaper honors the run-registry heartbeat that active node execution already emits every few seconds, so a first task with a 600-second budget is not globally paused as `stale_no_provider_activity` at the exact timeout boundary before the node can fail or repair normally.

Automation V2 research validation now preserves source URLs from successful `websearch` and `webfetch` tool results. If a generated JSON artifact is too sparse and omits raw links, the validator can still see the current web evidence that was actually gathered instead of blocking the node as `citations_missing`. The prompt and repair guidance also now explicitly tell research agents to include raw URLs in `citations` or `web_sources_reviewed` fields.

Connector-backed source research now has to use the selected connector, not merely discover it. A node that says to use Reddit MCP and resolves `reddit-gmail` can no longer complete after only `mcp_list` plus a JSON write; it must call a concrete source tool such as `mcp.reddit_gmail.reddit_search_across_subreddits` or `mcp.reddit_gmail.reddit_retrieve_reddit_post`, preserving real returned evidence or an actual connector/tool limitation.

The prompt and tool surface now reinforce that rule before validation has to catch it. Connector source prompts list concrete `mcp.*` tools and state that `mcp_list`, `glob`, `grep`, `edit`, and `apply_patch` are not source evidence, while non-code connector source nodes no longer offer edit/patch/bash tools that can distract agents from calling the connector.

Connector-backed delivery nodes now keep their destination MCP tools focused all the way through artifact creation. Notion save/report nodes with explicit `mcp.notion.*` tool allowlists no longer inherit generic workspace `read`/`glob` or mutation tools from upstream input refs, but they still retain the required `write` tool for the run artifact receipt. The engine loop also narrows prewrite MCP gating to the specific concrete connector tools that have not yet run, steering a Notion publisher from `notion_fetch` to `notion_create_pages` instead of letting it loop on already-completed discovery or local inspection.

Required-tool provider calls now fail closed inside Tandem instead of being rejected by the provider when routing filters remove every tool. Write-required connector nodes keep the artifact `write` tool even when their session allowlist is connector-only, and if a later filter still produces an empty tool set Tandem downgrades the provider request away from `tool_choice: required` rather than sending an invalid no-tools request.

Transient provider stream decode failures are now treated as recoverable provider infrastructure failures. Stream errors such as `error decoding response body`, unexpected EOF, and incomplete streamed responses are retried inside the current provider iteration with partial streamed text/tool-call state cleared before retry. The retry budget is bounded by `TANDEM_PROVIDER_STREAM_DECODE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`, and each retry emits a `provider.call.iteration.retry` event for debugging.

Automation V2 governance now gives repair attempts a calmer, more actionable handoff. Attempt verdicts include a `calm_teammate_v1` review with a progress score, what the agent completed correctly, what is still needed, why the missing work matters, and the next concrete moves. Repair prompts show that review before the raw expected/observed contract JSON, so retries can keep good evidence and fix the smallest missing piece rather than restarting from a vague validation failure.

Bug Monitor failure reports now preserve both the final failure and the useful prior attempt evidence. Automation V2 failure events carry recent attempt verdict chains and attempt review chains into Bug Monitor submissions, making issue details show earlier contract misses such as missing workspace files, missing connector calls, citation gaps, or required next actions even when the final observed failure is a provider stream/runtime error.

Stale provider/session recovery now retries by default instead of stopping at a pause. When the stale reaper cancels a dead session, the in-progress node is marked `needs_repair` and the stale-reaped run is automatically requeued while attempt budget remains. The existing auto-resume cap keeps truly wedged providers from looping forever, and operators can opt out with `TANDEM_DISABLE_STALE_AUTO_RESUME`.

The control panel also avoids presenting active workflow sessions as stalled. A running Automation V2 run with active sessions stays visually `running`, and background-tab polling gaps are shown as a softer "waiting on active session" detail. The backend stale reaper remains the authority for real `stale_no_provider_activity` pauses.

The control-panel Chat view now waits for the completed assistant message to materialize in the exact active session before clearing the live thinking/streaming state. This closes the blank-response gap where an answer was saved on the server and appeared after refresh, but the live UI had already removed `Thinking...` without rendering the final assistant message.

Hosted Files now distinguishes workspace-root configuration from workspace-files API availability. The Files page only enables workspace browsing when capabilities explicitly advertise the API route, so managed-file deployments no longer spam `/api/workspace/files/list?dir=` 404s.

Chat also preflights active-run cleanup before sending a new prompt. If a stale session run is still registered, the UI cancels and waits for idle before posting `prompt_async`, with the 409 conflict payload still used as a fallback if a race appears between the preflight and send.

The Coder board now matches ACA's updated GitHub Project intake rules for launchable work. `Todo` and `TODOS` lanes are recognized as runnable in the control panel, and planned GitHub tasks are moved into the detected launch lane rather than assuming the project has a `Ready` status. This fixes projects where the coding agent should accept cards from `TODOS` but the board UI left them looking unlaunchable or published new tasks into the wrong lane.

Workflow tasks now have first-class per-node tool access. Automation V2 nodes can carry their own `tool_policy` and `mcp_policy`, and the runtime treats those policies as a hard session scope rather than a hint layered on top of broader workflow access. This is especially important for approval-gated Gmail draft workflows: the compose and draft-create steps can be scoped away from send tools, while the post-approval step can be scoped to the concrete send-draft MCP tool that should run only after approval.

The control panel exposes this in both Workflow Studio and the existing automation edit dialog. Each node has a default-collapsed Task tool access panel with clear inherit/custom markers, MCP server/tool selectors, and a send-capable marker so operators can quickly spot which task is allowed to send. Saving a workflow preserves node-level built-in tool allowlists/denylists plus exact MCP server/tool choices.

The runtime also understands node MCP policy when computing concrete MCP allowlists and connector discovery behavior. Explicit node policies, including empty custom policies, are treated as intentional constraints. A regression test covers the Gmail approval case by allowing `mcp.reddit_gmail.gmail_send_draft` on the post-approval node while filtering out `gmail_create_email_draft` and `gmail_send_email`.

Channel-level MCP server toggles are now enforced as a hard runtime boundary. If an MCP server is disabled for a channel or conversation scope, agents do not receive tools from that connection, even when stale exact-tool preferences or a route-level allowlist still mention those tools. Exact MCP tool selections only apply while their owning server is enabled; selecting exact tools now narrows access rather than layering on top of a server wildcard. Channel defaults also avoid a broad `*` tool allowlist so MCP access must be explicitly granted.

The channel settings UI now mirrors that model. Disabling an MCP server clears exact-tool selections for that server on save, exact-tool pickers are visibly inactive until the server is enabled, and the summary counts only active exact MCP tools. Telegram, Discord, and Slack settings also expose a `Strict KB grounding` toggle so operators can intentionally opt a channel into factual-question KB grounding without confusing that behavior with MCP tool access.

## v0.5.4 (Released 2026-05-05)

This patch fixes automation schedule timezone handling, tightens the distinction between local source-code research and final research synthesis, and introduces marketplace-ready workflow pack import/export.

Automation cron schedules now preserve the selected local wall-clock time end to end. The server accepts the 5-field cron expressions emitted by the control panel, normalizes them for the Rust cron parser, and evaluates them in the saved IANA timezone when computing `next_fire_at_ms`. The control panel now carries that timezone through guided schedule summaries, creation review, workflow editing, calendar labels, and standup scheduling, with `Europe/Budapest` available in the common timezone picker. A regression test covers weekday 9:00 AM in Budapest resolving correctly through DST-aware UTC storage.

Final report/brief nodes that synthesize already-collected Tandem MCP notes, Reddit MCP signals, web findings, and run artifacts no longer require fresh workspace `read` calls. The planner stops adding `local_source_reads` to new `research_synthesis` contracts, and the runtime validator waives stale local-read enforcement on existing saved synthesis nodes. Code-change, local-research, and Bug Monitor source-inspection nodes still retain their strict repo-read gates.

This prevents research-to-destination workflows from blocking with messages such as `research brief cited workspace sources without using read` when the workflow only cites MCP/web/upstream artifact evidence and does not need repository source files.

Workflow packs are now the preferred portable format for created workflows. The Workflows page can upload a `.zip` pack, preview its manifest, cover image, workflow entries, capabilities, and validation results, then install it and open the resulting planner session. Raw JSON workflow bundle import remains available under Advanced for debugging and internal handoffs.

Planner sessions can also be exported as marketplace-ready workflow pack ZIPs containing `tandempack.yaml`, `README.md`, the embedded workflow plan bundle, and an optional PNG/JPEG/WebP cover image. New workflow-pack APIs and TypeScript client helpers support export, preview, and import, while imported sessions keep pack provenance (`source_pack_id`, version, and source bundle digest) for later inspection.

Exported workflow packs now include a hosted-safe download URL, and the Workflows page shows a browser Download ZIP action after export so operators can retrieve generated packs without access to the server filesystem path. Control-panel uploads also now prefer `$TANDEM_HOME/data/channel_uploads` and expand home-directory placeholders such as `~`, `$HOME`, `${HOME}`, and `%HOME%`, avoiding stray literal upload directories when hosted or Windows-style environment values are used on Linux/macOS.

## v0.5.3 (Released 2026-05-03)

Automation V2 workflow definitions now use per-workflow storage shards. Instead of rewriting every saved workflow into one large `automations_v2.json` file, Tandem writes each definition to `data/automations-v2/<automation-id>.json` and keeps a small `index.json` alongside the shards. On startup, existing aggregate installs are migrated automatically and the old aggregate is preserved as `automations_v2.legacy-aggregate.json` for rollback/debugging.
