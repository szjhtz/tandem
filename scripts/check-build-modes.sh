# check-build-modes.sh (EAA-09 / TAN-34): prove the three Tandem engine build
# modes compose exactly as designed.
#
# The engine is the `tandem-ai` package (binary `tandem-engine`). The enterprise
# server split defines three build modes, distinguished purely by the engine
# features passed to cargo:
#
#   * public          (no features, optionally `browser`)
#         Lean, single-tenant, open-source build. Must NOT pull the enterprise
#         server, the premium governance engine, or the heavyweight local
#         embedding stack (fastembed / ort).
#   * enterprise-lite (`enterprise-server`)
#         Hosted build that registers `/enterprise/*` routes (connectors,
#         source bindings, cross-tenant grants) but stays lean — it must pull
#         `tandem-enterprise-server` yet still exclude governance and the local
#         embedding stack.
#   * enterprise-full (`enterprise-full`)
#         The complete enterprise artifact: enterprise routes plus governance,
#         Google Drive, and local embeddings. Must pull all of the heavyweight
#         crates.
#
# Cargo only activates a feature when it is passed via `--features`, so each mode
# is checked with the exact feature set its artifacts are built with. The check
# uses `cargo tree` (dependency resolution only, no compilation) so it is cheap
# and deterministic. On failure the offending dependency path is printed via
# `cargo tree -i` so the unexpected edge is easy to locate.
#
# This guard supersedes the public-only exclusion check (check-public-build-
# exclusions.sh) by validating all three modes; it delegates the public mode to
# that script so the EAA-11 guard remains the single source of truth for the
# public exclusion set.
