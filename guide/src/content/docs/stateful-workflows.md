title: Building Stateful Workflows in Tandem
description: Build and operate Automation V2 workflows with durable run state, approval waits, webhook triggers, MCP boundaries, inspection, and recovery.
---

Use this page when an operator or agent needs to build a workflow that must keep
track of completed work, pause safely, react to an external event, or recover
without starting over.

Agent search terms: stateful workflow, durable workflow, Automation V2
checkpoint, approval wait, webhook trigger, webhook step, resume run, replay,
dead letter, compensation, MCP workflow, run recovery.

## What "stateful" means in Tandem

A saved Automation V2 definition is persistent, but that alone does not make
each execution stateful. The stateful part is the durable run record that tracks
which nodes finished, what they produced, whether the run is waiting, and which
recovery actions remain safe.

| Object                 | What it stores                                                                           | What it is not                                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Automation definition  | Agents, DAG nodes, policies, schedule, workspace, and trigger configuration              | A particular execution                               |
| Automation run         | One execution of a frozen automation snapshot                                            | A reusable knowledge base                            |
| Checkpoint             | Completed, pending, and blocked nodes; node outputs and attempts; gates and failures     | The live event stream                                |
| Node output            | The bounded result of one node, available to downstream nodes                            | Automatically trusted cross-run knowledge            |
| Context-run blackboard | A task-oriented projection of run and node state, plus durable patches and artifacts     | A replacement for the Automation V2 checkpoint       |
| Artifact               | A durable file, handoff, report, draft, or receipt                                       | Semantic memory unless explicitly stored or promoted |
| Event                  | An append-oriented fact about what happened                                              | The complete current state by itself                 |
| Snapshot               | A point-in-time state and checkpoint projection used for inspection or replay boundaries | Permission to repeat external side effects           |
| Wait                   | A durable pause such as approval, timer, or webhook correlation                          | A normal DAG dependency                              |
| Reliability record     | Outbox entry, tool effect, dead letter, or compensation record                           | Proof that an external action is safe to repeat      |
| Promoted knowledge     | Reviewed project knowledge reusable by later runs                                        | Raw notes or every prior node output                 |

Events are useful for progress, while checkpoints and snapshots are the durable
source of execution state. Artifacts and promoted knowledge have different trust
and reuse rules; do not flatten them into one generic "memory" layer.

There is no `stateful: true` flag. Automation V2 runs are projected into the
stateful runtime automatically.

## Build a webhook review and publish workflow

This supported pattern starts a new run from a signed webhook, treats the
delivery as an untrusted wake signal, validates current work through a read-only
authoritative lookup, writes a reviewable artifact, waits for a verified human,
and gives only the final node permission to publish through MCP.

### 1. Prepare the engine and MCP capability

1. Authenticate to a running engine and verify `GET /global/health`.
2. Use `mcp_list` first, then `mcp_list_catalog` if you need to distinguish a
   disconnected catalog entry from an unknown capability. Discover one
   read-only source query and one post-approval publish tool.
3. Connect the MCP through the operator path and confirm the exact namespaced
   tool ID with `GET /mcp/tools` or `GET /tool/ids`.
4. Replace the illustrative Slack server/tool names below with the exact IDs
   returned by your engine.

An MCP server being visible in a catalog is not execution authority. Both the
agent and the node must have the narrow policy required for their step.

### 2. Create the Automation V2 definition

The engine's raw Automation V2 JSON uses snake_case. The current TypeScript
client's public node type does not enumerate every raw gate, metadata, and
output-contract field, so the example deliberately casts the source-backed raw
payload at the SDK boundary.

```ts
import { TandemClient } from "@frumu/tandem-client";

const client = new TandemClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.TANDEM_ENGINE_URL ?? "http://127.0.0.1:39731",
  token: process.env.TANDEM_ENGINE_TOKEN!,
});

console.log({ automationId, callbackUrl });
// Store oneTimeSecret in a secret manager now. Do not log or commit it.
```

Python callers can submit the same snake_case Automation V2 payload; use the
[Python SDK guide](../sdk/python/) for client setup and response handling rather
than duplicating the full definition.

Replace `/workspace/project` with an absolute workspace path owned by this
automation.

The illustrative Linear and Slack MCP names are not portable. Discover the real
namespaced tool IDs first and save each exact ID in both the relevant node tool
policy and MCP policy. Keep the guard's query filters fixed in the definition;
never derive them from webhook content.

### 3. Control Panel path

1. Open **Automations** and create a manual Automation V2 workflow in Studio.
2. Add the four nodes in the same order and review every node-level policy.
3. Give the guard only the fixed read-only source query, keep the approval node
   tool-free, and keep the send tool only on the final node.
4. Save the automation as active.
5. Open its webhook manager, create a standard HMAC trigger, and store the
   one-time secret securely.
6. Send a test event, open **Recent deliveries**, and follow the queued run.
7. Review the artifact and decide the pending approval as a verified human.
8. Confirm the final node recorded a destination receipt.

Approval is an authority boundary, not another agent task. An agent cannot
approve its own gate.

## Trigger the workflow with a webhook

### Webhooks start runs, not arbitrary nodes

A public webhook trigger belongs to an Automation V2 definition. When a valid
delivery has no matching internal wait, Tandem creates a run with
`trigger_type: "webhook"`; normal DAG eligibility starts the root nodes. The
webhook does not select `validate_event` by name and cannot jump directly to
`publish_approved`.

Tandem stores sanitized run metadata under
`automation_snapshot.metadata.automation_webhook`, including the provider,
configured event-kind label, delivery and trigger IDs, body digest, idempotency
fields, verification result, and sanitized `preview`. Operators can inspect it
through the run and delivery surfaces.

Current public Automation V2 authoring does **not** inject that metadata into a
root node prompt or expose it as an `input_refs` source. Do not write a guard
prompt that claims it can read `automation_webhook`. In this example, the
delivery starts the run and the guard queries the authoritative provider with a
fixed read-only filter.

`provider_event_kind` labels the trigger and the resulting metadata. It is not a
JSON payload filter. Use separate triggers when the label matters operationally,
and perform project, label, entity, and state checks against data the guard can
actually read, such as an authoritative connector lookup. With
`metadata.triage_gate: true`, returning
`has_work: false` skips nodes that depend only on that triage path.

### Send a standard signed event

The public callback accepts JSON bodies up to 1 MiB. Standard Tandem HMAC signs
the exact bytes of `<timestamp_ms>.<raw_json_body>`.

```bash
export TANDEM_WEBHOOK_SECRET='store-this-outside-source-control'
export CALLBACK_URL='https://engine.example.com/webhooks/automations/your-public-token'
BODY='{"action":"review_requested","request_id":"review-123","summary":"Publish the approved operations update"}'
TIMESTAMP_MS="$(node -e 'process.stdout.write(Date.now().toString())')"
SIGNATURE="$(BODY="$BODY" TIMESTAMP_MS="$TIMESTAMP_MS" node -e '
  const crypto = require("node:crypto");
  const payload = `${process.env.TIMESTAMP_MS}.${process.env.BODY}`;
  process.stdout.write(
    crypto.createHmac("sha256", process.env.TANDEM_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
      .update(payload)
      .digest("hex")
  );
')"

curl -sS -X POST "$CALLBACK_URL" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Tandem-Webhook-Signature: t=$TIMESTAMP_MS,v1=$SIGNATURE" \
  -H 'X-Tandem-Webhook-Event-ID: review-123' \
  --data-binary "$BODY"
```

An HTTP `202 Accepted` means Tandem durably accepted the raw event for
asynchronous processing. It does not mean a run or node completed.

### Create and inspect through HTTP

The TypeScript example above is the canonical full payload. The equivalent raw
HTTP sequence is:

```bash
ENGINE_URL="${TANDEM_ENGINE_URL:-http://127.0.0.1:39731}"
AUTH="Authorization: Bearer $TANDEM_ENGINE_TOKEN"

# Save automationSpec as snake_case JSON in automation.json first.
curl -sS -X POST "$ENGINE_URL/automations/v2" \
  -H "$AUTH" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @automation.json

curl -sS -X POST "$ENGINE_URL/automations/v2/$AUTOMATION_ID/webhook-triggers" \
  -H "$AUTH" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name":"Review requested",
    "provider":"custom",
    "provider_event_kind":"review.requested",
    "signature_scheme":"hmac_sha256_v1"
  }'

curl -sS \
  "$ENGINE_URL/automations/v2/$AUTOMATION_ID/webhook-triggers/$TRIGGER_ID/deliveries?limit=20" \
  -H "$AUTH"
```

Read the newest delivery's `status`, `delivery_id`, and `queued_run_id`. Follow
`queued_run_id` to the run APIs. A runtime-internal wake instead exposes
`woken_run_id` and `woken_wait_id`.

### Start-versus-resume truth table

| Delivery situation                         | Runtime result                                          | Public workflow-authoring meaning                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Valid event, no matching wait              | Creates one new webhook-triggered run                   | Supported path; guard the root and route through dependencies                                           |
| Rejected, disabled, or suppressed delivery | Does not create a run                                   | Inspect the delivery status and reason code; do not infer execution from the intake response            |
| Duplicate event or body                    | Does not create a second run                            | Inspect `duplicate_of_delivery_id`, `duplicate_of_run_id`, and dedupe reason                            |
| Same event ID with changed body            | Rejects as an idempotency conflict                      | Do not reuse an event ID for different content                                                          |
| Notion verification handshake              | Stores/reveals the verification token; no workflow run  | Finish Notion subscription verification first                                                           |
| Matching runtime-registered webhook wait   | Requeues the waiting run and records woken run/wait IDs | Runtime capability only; no public Automation V2/API/SDK/MCP authoring surface declares this wait today |

Duplicate redelivery is suppressed before it can create another run. Tandem
uses trigger-scoped provider event IDs when available and always tracks the body
digest. Use a stable provider event ID and keep the body immutable for retries.

For provider-specific GitHub, Notion, and Linear signatures, secret ownership,
and setup, use [Automation V2 Webhooks](../automation-v2-webhooks/).

## Approval and continuation

When `approve_publish` becomes eligible, the run records an approval wait and
enters `awaiting_approval`. Inspect pending approvals, review the artifact, and
submit the decision as a verified human:

```bash
curl -sS "$ENGINE_URL/approvals/pending?source=automation_v2" -H "$AUTH"

curl -sS -X POST "$ENGINE_URL/automations/v2/runs/$RUN_ID/gate" \
  -H "$AUTH" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"decision":"approve","reason":"Artifact and destination verified"}'
```

The current server decision vocabulary is `approve`, `rework`, or `cancel`.
Use `cancel`, not `deny`, when publication should stop. Rework can return work to
configured `rework_targets`. An expired gate refuses a late decision.

After approval, the existing run continues from its checkpoint. Completed nodes
are not recreated, and the final node receives only its declared upstream input
and exact MCP authority.

## State within a run and across runs

| Need                                  | Store or mechanism            | Reuse boundary                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Know which nodes already finished     | Automation V2 checkpoint      | Same run                         |
| Feed a bounded result to another node | Node output plus `input_refs` | Same run                         |
| Track work as tasks and patches       | Context-run blackboard        | Same run                         |
| Preserve a report, draft, or receipt  | Artifact or handoff file      | Run or workspace                 |
| Reconstruct how execution changed     | Events plus snapshots         | Same run and audit history       |
| Reuse reviewed facts in a later run   | Promoted project knowledge    | Later runs in the approved scope |

Do not use global memory as a substitute for workflow state. Raw webhook bodies,
working notes, and failed drafts should not become trusted reusable knowledge
automatically.

For a quick inspection:

```bash
curl -sS "$ENGINE_URL/automations/v2/runs/$RUN_ID" -H "$AUTH"
curl -sS "$ENGINE_URL/stateful-runtime/runs/$RUN_ID" -H "$AUTH"
curl -sS "$ENGINE_URL/stateful-runtime/runs/$RUN_ID/events?tail=50" -H "$AUTH"
curl -sS "$ENGINE_URL/stateful-runtime/runs/$RUN_ID/resume-plan" -H "$AUTH"
```

An event describes a transition. Confirm historical or recovery-sensitive facts
against the checkpoint, latest snapshot, wait, and reliability records.

## Recover safely

1. Inspect `checkpoint.completed_nodes`, `pending_nodes`, `blocked_nodes`, node
   outputs, attempts, `awaiting_gate`, and `last_failure`.
2. Inspect the latest snapshot and the events after its sequence.
3. Check reliability records before repeating any external tool call. An unknown
   effect is not safe to retry merely because the model did not see a result.
4. Fetch the resume plan and use only an enabled operator choice.
5. Prefer a task retry, requeue, or governed failed-effect retry over recreating
   the automation.
6. Require operator review before compensation or abandonment, and preserve the
   resulting audit event.

The resume-plan choices do not all execute work. At the current runtime
revision, failed-effect retry can dispatch governed re-execution and a
compensation choice can invoke the compensation engine. Choices such as
`resume_from_checkpoint` or `reconcile_external_effect` record operator intent
and evidence; inspect the response's `execution_mode` and `automatic_dispatch`
instead of assuming a POST resumed work.

### Reliability terms

- **Outbox record:** intended external operation and its idempotency/policy
  context.
- **Tool effect:** observed success, failure, or uncertainty plus a bounded
  receipt pointer.
- **Dead letter:** exhausted or unsafe work with explicit recovery choices.
- **Compensation:** governed rollback or forward-fix proposal, often requiring
  approval.

Never compensate by asking a general-purpose agent to improvise an inverse
action. Use the recorded target effect and governed compensation path.

## Webhook security and delivery outcomes

- Public intake requires JSON and rejects bodies larger than 1 MiB.
- The stored trigger selects tenant, workspace, deployment, automation, and
  authority. Payload fields never select those boundaries.
- Signed schemes verify the exact raw bytes. A proxy that rewrites JSON can
  break verification.
- Standard Tandem HMAC timestamps have a bounded clock-skew window.
- Secrets are one-time or provider-owned material. Do not place them in prompts,
  workflow JSON, logs, screenshots, or artifacts.
- `unsigned_dev_mode` is local development only and must never be exposed on an
  internet-facing callback.
- Delivery statuses include received, accepted, rejected, duplicate,
  suppressed, disabled, and failed. Read the reason codes rather than inferring
  execution from HTTP `202`.
- The run record retains a sanitized preview for inspection; nodes do not
  currently receive it as a public input. Fetch current provider data through a
  narrowly authorized connector instead of trusting event content.

## Storage and deployment limitation

The current stateful runtime kernel stores events, snapshots, waits, and
reliability records in JSON and JSONL files. This is suitable for the current
single-server local/runtime profile, but those files do not provide
cross-process compare-and-swap.

Do not run multiple independent Tandem engine processes against the same
runtime data root. See the
[Stateful Runtime Durable Kernel note](https://github.com/frumu-ai/tandem/blob/main/docs/STATEFUL_RUNTIME_DURABLE_KERNEL.md)
for the transactional-storage direction.

## Agent operating checklist

When an MCP-connected agent is asked to build or repair a stateful workflow:

1. Authenticate and verify engine health.
2. Discover MCP availability and exact tool IDs before authoring policies.
3. Choose Automation V2 and separate validation, work, approval, and external
   mutation into distinct nodes.
4. Give each node only the tools and inputs needed for that step.
5. Use a triage guard with fixed, read-only authoritative checks and return
   `has_work: false` when no in-scope work exists.
6. Preview or review the definition before activating triggers.
7. Treat `202` as intake acknowledgement and follow the delivery-to-run IDs.
8. Never decide the workflow's own human approval gate.
9. Inspect checkpoint, snapshots, and reliability records before retrying.
10. Preserve provenance and promote only reviewed knowledge for later runs.
