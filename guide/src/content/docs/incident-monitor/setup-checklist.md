title: Incident Monitor Setup Checklist
description: Configure current Incident Monitor behavior and prepare for destination-router Incident Monitor concepts.
---

Use this checklist when setting up current Incident Monitor or preparing for destination-router Incident Monitor work.

## Current GitHub setup

1. Enable Incident Monitor in `Settings -> Incident Monitor`.
2. Set the GitHub repo in `owner/repo` format.
3. Select an MCP server with GitHub list, get, create, and comment capabilities.
4. Keep `require_approval_for_new_issues` aligned with team policy.
5. Run status/readiness and confirm GitHub read/write capabilities are available.
6. Submit a manual report or external log fixture.
7. Create or refresh the triage run.
8. Preview or publish only after the draft has enough evidence.
9. Confirm the post receipt includes the destination ID, external URL, and evidence digest.

## External source setup

1. Add `monitored_projects` with stable `project_id`, `repo`, and `workspace_root`.
2. Add `log_sources` with stable `source_id` values.
3. Set `source_kind`, route tags, tenant/workspace IDs, and schema version where known.
4. Set `allowed_destination_ids` and `default_destination_ids` for any source that must be constrained.
5. Create scoped intake keys only for report-only external systems.
6. Confirm scoped keys cannot publish, mutate routes/destinations, call tools, or inspect files.

## Destination-router setup

1. Define destinations explicitly when moving beyond the legacy fallback.
2. Add routes only when default destinations are insufficient.
3. Use route preview to confirm matches, readiness, approval, and blocked reasons.
4. Keep non-GitHub destinations disabled until their adapters are implemented.
5. Preserve `legacy-github` behavior for old configs.

## Security posture preparation

1. Inventory agents, workflows, tools, sources, destinations, approvals, and tenant/workspace context.
2. Add deterministic checks before adding controlled probes.
3. Make probes authorized, bounded, and dry-run or sandboxed where possible.
4. Export evidence to a customer-owned audit destination when assessing Tandem itself.
