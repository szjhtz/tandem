title: Incident Monitor Production Governance
description: Map Incident Monitor evidence, deployment cards, posture checks, and destination routing to production governance controls.

Use this page when an operator, auditor, or agent needs to answer whether an Incident Monitor deployment is ready for production governance review.

Incident Monitor is not a compliance certification engine. It records what Tandem observed, which authority surfaces exist, which checks ran, which route or approval decision was made, and where evidence was exported. A deployer still owns the policy mapping, retention schedule, reviewer assignments, incident reporting obligations, and external system of record.

## What Tandem Can Prove

Tandem can provide evidence that:

- a source, workflow, agent, destination, route, approval, policy decision, or publish receipt existed in Tandem's governed runtime
- an assessment report, posture check, or controlled probe was generated from a redacted authority inventory
- a publish attempt used the destination router rather than a direct external mutation path
- scoped intake credentials were report-only and rejected privileged routes when checked
- a deployment card had or lacked required owner, purpose, escalation, approval, data-classification, and review metadata
- protected audit evidence was available for customer-owned review or export

## What Tandem Cannot Prove Alone

Tandem does not independently prove that:

- every customer system, credential, shadow agent, or external integration is connected to Tandem
- the customer's policy mapping is complete or legally sufficient
- a destination such as GitHub, Linear, SIEM, object storage, or a webhook receiver retained evidence correctly after export
- third-party systems are free of vulnerabilities
- all model-level failure modes, prompt-injection attacks, or data-quality issues were detected
- Tandem is safe merely because Tandem monitored itself

Use Tandem evidence as runtime governance input, then reconcile it with customer-owned identity, access, data, compliance, and incident-response controls.

## Production Readiness Checklist

Before using Incident Monitor for production governance:

1. Generate deployment cards for Tandem self-monitoring, monitored sources, high-authority agents, and workflows that can mutate external systems.
2. Fill required owner, accountable team, intended purpose, autonomy level, data classification, approval protocol, escalation protocol, and review cadence metadata.
3. Run authority inventory and deterministic posture checks with full admin context.
4. Run only authorized dry-run probes, and record sandbox boundaries for each probe.
5. Preview routes for representative high-risk, external, legal/regulatory, and low-risk incidents.
6. Confirm destination readiness for every configured publish target.
7. Confirm source readiness for every production monitored source, including lineage, freshness, schema drift, authorization, redaction, and retention coverage.
8. Confirm high-risk or sensitive destinations require approval and redaction.
9. Configure retention/export policy for reports, receipts, protected audit evidence, and customer-owned records.
10. Assign finding owners and escalation paths before enabling external publish routes.
11. Schedule periodic drift review for stale deployment cards, stale sources, repeated failures, approval waits, and route changes.

## Compliance Mapping Notes

| Compliance question                         | Useful Tandem evidence                                                                                    | Still deployer-owned                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Who is accountable for this agent or route? | Deployment card owner/accountable team fields and required-field findings                                 | Organizational assignment and reviewer qualification                                          |
| What data can enter this monitor?           | Source identity, scoped intake keys, source bindings, data classification metadata, redaction profiles    | Data-class policy, minimization, lawful basis, and source-system authorization                |
| Can the agent mutate external systems?      | Destination inventory, route preview, MCP allowlists, approval policy, publish receipts                   | Business approval policy and connected-system authorization                                   |
| Was a risky action reviewed?                | Approval coverage, approval decisions, protected audit summaries, assessment report evidence refs         | Reviewer competence, dual-control policy, and legal/regulatory escalation                     |
| Where is evidence retained?                 | Report artifacts, protected audit export summaries, post receipts, delivery IDs, evidence digests         | SIEM/object-store/database custody, retention period, access review, legal hold               |
| How are incidents escalated?                | Incident records, failed receipts, posture findings, route suggestions, deployment-card escalation fields | Incident response playbooks, reporting thresholds, customer notification, regulator reporting |

## Edge Cases To Call Out

- If a source has no allowed/default destination policy, route preview can reveal surprising fallback behavior before publish.
- If `retention_days` is unset, Tandem can still record receipts and reports, but production use needs customer-owned retention policy.
- If a generic MCP destination is enabled, treat it as high risk until the server/tool allowlist, payload mapping, approval policy, and receipt behavior are reviewed.
- If Tandem monitors itself, export evidence outside Tandem before relying on it for audit or incident response.
- If a posture finding depends on customer policy that Tandem cannot infer, keep it as an open question rather than silently passing the deployment.
