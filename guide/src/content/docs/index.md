description: Tandem is the authority layer for AI-first work. Use these docs to set up runtime authority for agents, tools, memory, approvals, and audit trails.

Welcome to the **Tandem documentation hub**. Tandem is the authority layer for AI-first work: an engine-owned runtime that controls what agents can see, which tools they can use, when humans must approve, and what evidence survives after the work is done.

To help you find what you need quickly, please select the path that best describes how you plan to use Tandem:

- **[Channel Integrations](./channel-integrations/)** — Connect Telegram, Discord, and Slack with media-aware prompt flow.
- **[Deployment Guide](./desktop/headless-deployment/)** — Learn best practices for securely exposing Tandem.
- **[Protocol Matrix](./protocol-matrix/)** — Understand the ports and network boundaries.

### Setting up enterprise systems with agents

Start with the [Enterprise Client Onboarding Runbook](./enterprise-client-onboarding-runbook/) when the goal is to get a client live quickly, then use [Enterprise Data Governance](./enterprise-data-governance/) for the deeper endpoint and policy details.

Agents can help operators design and verify enterprise setups, but they should
work through the runtime's governance surfaces instead of bypassing them. A
useful agent can:

- map business domains into org units and access grants for admin review
- draft connector, source-binding, and data-class plans before credentials are attached
- inspect MCP availability with `mcp_list` and `mcp_list_catalog`
- request missing connector capabilities instead of self-connecting them
- generate staged automation definitions with narrow `tool_policy` and `mcp_policy`
- create runbooks for quarantine review, connector rotation, and incident response

Agents should not paste raw secrets, grant themselves enterprise admin access,
or treat catalog visibility as permission to execute connector tools.
